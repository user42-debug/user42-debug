## Whoami

I'm a French student who loves coding, and I want to marry the complete graph **K₄₂**.  
My **Dijkstra** is still searching for the shortest path to women's hearts. Maybe I should try **Bellman-Ford**...

I discovered coding when I was 11 during COVID. I started with a book about HTML and CSS. Now, I mostly code in **C++**, sometimes in **Python** for AI projects.  
Coding is not just a skill for me, it’s a way to navigate through complexity and bring order to chaos. Every bug fixed is a node visited, every algorithm optimized is a path shortened.

My passion for competitive programming grows as fast as **A(n)**.
